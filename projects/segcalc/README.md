# Segmentation of calcifications in mammography

This folder contain the project specific code to segment calcifications in mammography.

## Available scripts in project
- `convert_points_to_segmentation.py`: assuming a JSON data format, convert point annotations to segmentations by a local threshold (with some additions).
- `extend_dataset_description.py`: Replaces the `annotation` key with a `mask` key (as generated by `convert_points_to_segmentation.py`) and adds metadata of the original file.
